📚 Dask Library (Theory Explanation)
What is Dask?
Dask is a parallel computing library in Python.
It helps you process big data by breaking it into smaller chunks and using multiple cores (or even multiple machines).

🔥 Think of Dask as:

🐼 Pandas → for small data
🚀 Dask → for big data (that doesn't fit in RAM)

✅ Why Dask? (Advantages)
Handles Big Data: Can process datasets larger than memory (RAM).

Scales Easily: Works on your laptop or across a big cluster (cloud, servers).

Parallel Processing: Uses multiple CPU cores automatically.

Compatible with Pandas & NumPy: Very similar syntax (easy to learn).

Lazy Evaluation: Delays computation until needed (like Polars/Spark).

🔥 Key Features of Dask
Feature	Explanation
Dask DataFrame	Big data version of Pandas DataFrame
Dask Array	Big data version of NumPy array
Dask Delayed	For custom parallel tasks
Dask Bag	For unstructured data (like text, logs)
Scalability	Runs on a single laptop or huge clusters
