✅ What is Pandas?
Pandas is a powerful open-source library in Python used for data analysis and data manipulation.
It provides fast, flexible, and easy-to-use data structures for working with structured (tables, Excel, CSV) and time series data.

The name Pandas stands for:
"Python Data Analysis Library" (derived from "Panel Data").

🔰 Why Use Pandas?
Easily handle tabular data (like Excel/CSV)

Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates)

Perform data analysis (grouping, sorting, filtering)

Merge, join, and reshape datasets

Read/write from different file formats like CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL

Integrates well with libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn


🛠️ Common Pandas Operations
Operation	             Description
read_csv()	        Load data from a CSV file
head(), tail()	        View top/bottom rows
info(), describe()	Summary of data
dropna(), fillna()	Handle missing values
sort_values()	        Sort data
groupby()	        Group and aggregate data
merge(), join()	        Combine multiple datasets
iloc[], loc[]	        Indexing and selecting data
to_csv(), to_excel()	Save data to a file

📁 File Formats Supported by Pandas
File Type	Function
CSV	      read_csv() / to_csv()
Excel  	      read_excel() / to_excel()
JSON	      read_json() / to_json()
SQL	      read_sql() / to_sql()
💡 Advantages of Pandas
Easy syntax (similar to Excel)

Efficient and fast for large datasets

Built-in data cleaning tools

Excellent integration with data science libraries

🛑 Limitations of Pandas
Not ideal for very large datasets (use Dask or PySpark)

Uses more memory than NumPy

Requires learning curve for beginners

🧪 Real-Life Use Cases
Analyzing sales data

Cleaning and exploring survey results

Financial analysis

Handling machine learning datasets

Generating reports and dashboards
