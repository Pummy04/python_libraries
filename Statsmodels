‚úÖ Statsmodels: Theory 
üìö What is Statsmodels?
statsmodels is a Python library used for building, analyzing, and interpreting statistical models.
It‚Äôs especially powerful in fields like statistics, econometrics, and data science.

üìä Think of it this way:

Scikit-learn = For machine learning

Statsmodels = For pure statistics and hypothesis testing

üîé Main Features of Statsmodels
Linear Models (Regression)

Hypothesis Testing

Time Series Analysis

Statistical Tests (t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA)

Generalized Linear Models (GLM)

‚úÖ Key Concepts (Statsmodels Theory)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Regression (OLS - Ordinary Least Squares)
Used for simple and multiple linear regression.

OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is the most common method in statsmodels.
import statsmodels.api as sm
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
Theory: OLS minimizes the sum of squared errors ‚Äî meaning it finds the best-fit line by making (y - y_pred)^2 as small as possible.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis Testing
You can perform statistical tests like t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests.

Example:
from statsmodels.stats.weightstats import ttest_ind
t_stat, p_value, df = ttest_ind(group1, group2)
Theory: These tests help check if there is a significant difference between groups (based on the p-value).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Time Series Models
Includes models like ARIMA, SARIMAX, and Exponential Smoothing for forecasting.

Example:
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
model = ARIMA(data, order=(1,1,1)).fit()
Theory: Time series models capture trend + seasonality + noise to predict future values.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
Used when data follows non-normal distributions like Poisson or Binomial.

Logistic Regression is also a type of GLM.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Tests & Diagnostics
Durbin-Watson test ‚Üí Checks for autocorrelation

Breusch-Pagan test ‚Üí Checks for heteroscedasticity

Jarque-Bera test ‚Üí Checks for normality
