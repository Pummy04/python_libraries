üßë‚Äçüíª What is Scikit-learn (sklearn)?
Scikit-learn is an open-source machine learning library for Python.
It is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
It provides simple and efficient tools for:
Data mining
Data analysis
Machine learning models

‚úÖ It is widely used in both academic projects and industry-level machine learning tasks.

üì¶ Key Features of Scikit-learn
Supervised learning algorithms
Unsupervised learning algorithms
Model selection and evaluation
Preprocessing data
Pipelines for building workflows

üî• Major Components of Sklearn
1. Supervised Learning
Classification: Predict categories (e.g., spam or not spam)
Algorithms: LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, SVC, RandomForestClassifier
Regression: Predict continuous values (e.g., price of a house)
Algorithms: LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, SVR

2. Unsupervised Learning
Clustering: Grouping similar data (e.g., customer segmentation)
Algorithms: KMeans, DBSCAN
Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce number of features
Algorithms: PCA, t-SNE

3. Model Selection
Train/Test Split: train_test_split
Cross-Validation: cross_val_score
Grid Search: GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

4. Preprocessing
Scaling: StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler
Encoding: LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
Missing Values: SimpleImputer

5. Pipelines
Combine preprocessing and model in a single workflow using Pipeline.

‚öôÔ∏è Basic Workflow in Sklearn
Import library
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
