üìò What is openpyxl?
openpyxl is a Python library that allows you to interact with Excel 2010 and newer .xlsx files. Unlike older libraries like xlrd or xlwt (which work with .xls), openpyxl fully supports the newer Office Open XML format.

‚úÖ Key Features of openpyxl
Read and write Excel .xlsx files
You can open existing workbooks or create new ones.

Manipulate cells and data
Access or modify the value, font, style, formula, or format of any cell.

Sheet management
Add, delete, rename, or move sheets.

Style formatting
Change font, size, alignment, colors, borders, etc.

Charts and images
Create or edit bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and insert images.

Formulas support
You can read and write formulas (though evaluation must be done in Excel itself).

Data validation and filters
Add drop-down lists, validation rules, and filters.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Structure
An .xlsx file is structured like this:

Workbook ‚Üí Represents the Excel file.

Worksheet ‚Üí Individual sheets inside the workbook.

Cell ‚Üí Each cell contains data, style, and location.

from openpyxl import load_workbook, Workbook

# Create a new workbook
wb = Workbook()

# Access active worksheet
ws = wb.active

# Write data to cell
ws['A1'] = "Hello, Excel!"

# Save the workbook
wb.save("example.xlsx")
