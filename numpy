ðŸ§  What is NumPy?
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides:

Efficient array objects (ndarray)

Tools for performing mathematical operations on arrays

Functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation

ðŸ”§ Why use NumPy?
Faster operations compared to regular Python lists

Memory efficient

Ideal for working with large datasets

Backbone of many libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.

ðŸ§© Key Features of NumPy

Feature	Description
ndarray	N-dimensional array object
Broadcasting	Perform operations on arrays of different shapes
Vectorization	Replace loops with array expressions (faster code)
Math Functions	Like mean(), sum(), sqrt(), etc.
Random Module	Generate random numbers, matrices, distributions
Linear Algebra	Matrix operations like dot product, inverse, etc.
